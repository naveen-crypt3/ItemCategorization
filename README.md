# ItemCategorization
Multi-Class Prediction with Random Forest

#Problem Statement:
This project tackles automatic food item categorization, aiming to assign a new food item to multiple relevant categories (Cuisine, Dietary Preference, Meal Course, Preparation Method) based on its description.

#Approach:
*Data Preparation: We leverage a dataset containing food descriptions and corresponding category labels.
*Feature Engineering: TF-IDF vectorization converts textual descriptions into numerical features, capturing the importance of words within the food domain.
*Multi-Class Classification: Separate Random Forest classifiers are trained for each target category, learning to predict categories based on the TF-IDF features.

#Implementation Details:
*Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn (TF-IDF, train-test-split, Random Forest, metrics)
*Model Training: Each Random Forest model is trained on the respective features and target labels (Cuisine, Dietary Preference, etc.)
*Prediction Function: A function takes a new food item description, generates TF-IDF features, and predicts categories using the trained models.

#Challenges Faced:
*Data Size and Quality: Limited data or imbalanced categories could affect model performance.
*Feature Engineering: Choosing the most effective feature extraction technique is crucial.
*Model Selection and Tuning: Selecting the optimal classification algorithm and hyperparameters requires experimentation.

#Future Enhancements:
*Explore feature engineering techniques like n-grams or word embeddings.
*Experiment with different classification algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines).
*Integrate the model into a user-friendly interface for interactive food categorization.

#Conclusion:
This documented project demonstrates a multi-class classification approach for food item categorization. It provides a solid foundation for further development and refinement, making it a strong submission for a hackathon addressing item categorization challenges.
